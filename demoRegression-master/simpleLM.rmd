## make a simple regression model

```{r}
bears <- read.csv(file="BEARS.csv",header = TRUE)
#adjust factors to be factors
bears$SEX<- as.factor(bears$SEX)
bears$MONTH<- as.factor(bears$MONTH)
```

## Model LENGTH ~ NECK  this is an example  

```{r}
simpNeck <- lm(LENGTH~NECK, data=bears)
plot(LENGTH~NECK, data=bears)
abline(simpNeck)
summary.lm(simpNeck)
```

```{r}
simpHEADLEN <-lm(LENGTH~HEADLEN, data=bears)
plot(LENGTH~HEADLEN,data=bears)
abline(simpHEADLEN)
summary.lm(simpHEADLEN)
```

```{r}
simpAGE <- lm(LENGTH~AGE, data=bears)
plot(LENGTH~AGE, data=bears)
abline(simpAGE)
summary.lm(simpAGE)
```


## Compare all models that predict LENGTH other than NECK. Then order them from worst to best by its value of Adjusted-Rsquared (bigger is better), or by RSE (residual standard error) where smaller is better.
